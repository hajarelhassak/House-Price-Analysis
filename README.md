# House-Price-Analysis
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze house price data to uncover patterns and build a simple machine learning model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, location, and year built. The goal is to provide insights into the factors that most influence house prices and demonstrate a basic predictive model.

Dataset
Source: Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle
Description: The dataset contains various features about houses in Ames, Iowa, such as square footage, neighborhood, year built, and sale price. It’s often used for regression practice.

Objectives
Conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations.
Build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on specific features.
Document the process and findings in a way that is clear for others to follow.
Project Structure
data/: Folder containing the dataset (if included in the repo).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies needed to run the project.
README.md: Project overview and documentation (you are here).
Getting Started
To replicate this project, clone the repository and set up the environment:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries listed in requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/House-Price-Analysis.git
cd House-Price-Analysis
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook in the notebooks/ directory to follow the analysis steps.

Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values and irrelevant columns.
Normalized certain variables to improve analysis and modeling.
Documented each step in the Jupyter notebook.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted visual analysis to explore trends:
Distribution of sale prices.
Relationship between variables such as square footage, neighborhood, and price.
Heatmap to analyze correlations between features.
3. Modeling
Used a Linear Regression model for prediction.
Split data into training and test sets to evaluate performance.
Evaluated the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the metric.
4. Results
Found that features like “Gr Liv Area” (ground living area) and “Overall Qual” (overall quality) had strong influences on price.
The model achieved an RMSE of XX (replace with your actual result) on the test set, indicating [add interpretation of the performance, e.g., “reasonable predictive accuracy given the data”].
Results and Findings
The analysis provided insight into the factors that affect house prices, with features such as living area and overall quality standing out as key predictors. While the Linear Regression model provided a good baseline, further improvements could be made by exploring other models, feature engineering, or hyperparameter tuning.

Future Work
Modeling: Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that might improve predictive power.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model to improve accuracy.
